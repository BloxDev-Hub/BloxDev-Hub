# Vector
Before learning `Vector3` you need to know what is a "Vector". Vector is a physical quantity which has a magnitude and a direction. A vector is graphically represented by an arrow drawn parallel to he direction of vector, The length of the arrow represent maginitude of the vector.

## 2D Vector
In a 2 diemensions, where you have two coordinates/axis `X-Axis` and `Y-Axis`. They are perpendicular to each other.

A vector is drawn from the origin `O` to the `(8,8)` coordinate point of the plane. These coordinate points represent magnitude of the vector on X and Y axis and are written as `(X,Y)`. 

## 3D Vector
In three dimensional space, There are three axis `X-Axis`, `Y-Axis` and `Z-Axis`. A 3D vector is same as 2D but with an extra dimension.
