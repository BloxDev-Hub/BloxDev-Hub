# Higher-order Functions (HOFs)
Functions in Lua (and Luau, by extension) are considered first-class, much like datatypes like numbers, strings and tables.

Because of this, functions can be treated just like numbers, strings and tables. The biggest thing that you can do to functions however, is **storing them in variables**. This opens up many possibilities with your functions.

## The Beginning
Since functions are first-class, you can `return` functions just as well as returning a number/string/table? No kidding!
