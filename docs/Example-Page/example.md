## Modifying text
---

You can add the regular decorators to a text:

This is *italic*
This is also _italic_

This is **bold**
This is also __bold__

_This is **bold** and **italic**_

---
## Lists
---

You can create lists very easyly.

* Best helpers.
	* RemiProp761
	* remi the remington
	* Husbando material (aka remi)
	* remi the remi and remington
	* remiâ™ª
	* Discord! (aka remi)
	* Best misc manager (aka willie)
	* Best department head (aka willie)
	* Big Willie
	* The Willster
	* The guy in >tag joe
	* jim
	* eden (lie)
* Job done.

And you need top put a text in between so the idiotic thing can know where it ends.

1. This is an ordered list, well it can be taken as just simple text, well its just simple text and it always have been.
2. Below lies.
3. Above says the truth.

## Images
---

You can also put images, look

![placeholder](https://github.com/Rodevs-Helpers/Helpers-Documents/blob/editing/images/Chloe.jpg?raw=true)

I know its a little bit **big** but we can fix that using HTML tags

<img src=https://github.com/Rodevs-Helpers/Helpers-Documents/blob/editing/images/Chloe.jpg?raw=true alt="placeholder" width="75" />

---
## Additionals
---

You can also add links like [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVBfcS4Bpznvr251ilsnemQ).

You can create backquotes

As remi said once:
> Suck my hair

Creating dividers its also fun!
