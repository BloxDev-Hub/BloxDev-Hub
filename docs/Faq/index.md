# What is the helper department?
**Helper** is a community department within **RoDevs**, tasked with overseeing the development category relations and ensuring the ongoing maintenance of the quality of development channels

The primary objective of the **Helper Department** is to enhance the community's experience in development channels. The Helpers act as the ambassadors of these channels and are tasked with assisting community members in addressing development-related concerns. The Helper role is bestowed upon individuals who demonstrate active involvement in development channels and provide assistance to others in a helpful manner.

## How to become a helper?
The Helper Department consistently seeks new members, and we invite you to consider joining our team. To be eligible for a role in the Helper Department, prospective candidates should possess excellent communication skills, as well as the necessary skills to assist in the development of channels. It is important to note that begging for a Helper role outright may diminish your chances of being selected. By fulfilling these key requirements, you can increase your eligibility for a Helper role.

## Requirements: 
(NOTE: Meeting these requirements will not automatically grant you the helper role.)

* To qualify as a helper, you should demonstrate a high level of activity and engagement in development channels. The specific level of activity required may vary depending on the channel, and it's recommended that you contribute to multiple channels where possible.

* To be considered for the role, you must be actively involved in the community for a certain period of time, such as one month.

* Your record should not include any infractions that would make you unsuitable for the helper role. Instead of focusing solely on major or minor infractions, we will evaluate your overall suitability for the position based on your ability to help others in a constructive, non-toxic way.

* In addition to demonstrating a helpful attitude, it's important that you maintain a positive overall behavior within the community.

* You will need to demonstrate your expertise in a particular field to be considered for the position.
