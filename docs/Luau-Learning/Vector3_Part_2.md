Previously we talked about

* Vectors
* Magnitude of vectors
* Unit vectors
* Normal vectors

Now we will move further and talk about vector manipulation. 

## Addition of Vectors.
The addition of vectors means putting two or more vectors together. We will add two or more vectors to obtain a new vector equal to the sum of vectors.
There are two laws for the addition of vectors
Triangle law (Head to tail law)
Parallelogram law
In this guide, we will only explain **Triangle law** (sorry).

### Addition of Vectors with Triangle Law
According to this law, two vectors can be added by placing them together in such a way that the head of the one joins the tail of the other. Thus, the resultant vector can be obtained by joining the tail of the first vector with the head of the second vector. This can be explained in the following steps:

1. Consider two vectors U and V.

2. Place the vector **V** in such a manner that its tail connects to the head of **U**.

3. A resultant vector **R** is drawn in such a way that it connects the tail of **U** to the head of **V**.

Thus, when the two vectors **U** and **V** are added using the triangle law, we can see that a triangle is formed by the two original vectors **U** and **V**, and the sum vector **R**.

## Multiplication of Vectors
Multiplication of vectors is of two types

* Multiplication of a vector with a scalar.
* Multiplication of a vector with another vector.

### Multiplication of a vector with a scalar
For multiplying a vector by a scaler, multiply each component of the vector with the scaler. If **V** is a vector of coordinates `(8,5,9)` and is multiplied by `10`, their product **U** is given by

```
U = V * 10
U = (8, 5, 9) * 10
U = (80, 50, 90)
```
