# What happened?

We believe you have the right to ask why we shifted from helper documents to Blox Hub documents, so here are the answers!

Along with many reasons, we believe the environment in rodevs isn't suitable to carry on this project. "But why?" I am sure you all know why. If I go into details, I think it will be too much to read, and you don't really need to know much about it. If we felt the need to disclose the information with you guys, we surely will!

## Who owns this project?

Blox Hub Documents (formerly known as helper documents) were made by the helper department of Rodevs and were always owned by helpers. Now it's still under the same team, with the same people and faces, just not under any Discord server, so you don't need to worry much!

## What's the future of this project?

We are also excited to see that too. Our future is purely based on you guys! The more you use and promote our docs, the more you contribute to it, and the better our future will be.

## How to contribute?

We are actively working on a detailed guide on how you can contribute, but for the time being, please contact **sora_ana** on Discord. Everyone from any community who wants to contribute is highly welcomed.
