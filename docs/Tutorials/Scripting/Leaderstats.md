Title: Creating Leaderstats

# Leaderstats
Leaderstats/Leaderboard is the board that appears on the right top of the player's screen. If you are used to playing games on Roblox then you must have seen this in many games.

## How to create one?
Making a leader stats is pretty simple. First of all we will add a **script** in [ServerScriptService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerScriptService).

For making leader stats, we have to add a folder inside every player and name it **leaderstats**. Once made the folder, we will add value objects such as [IntValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/IntValue), [NumberValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/NumberValue), [StringValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StringValue) etc.

In the script, we will get every player that joins the game and create leader stats for it. To get each player, we will connect a function to [PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded). In the function, we will create the folder for leader stats and set values inside it.

```lua
local function stats_handler(player)
    local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
    leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
    leaderstats.Parent = player

    local points = Instance.new("IntValue")
    points.Name = "Points"
    points.Parent = leaderstats
end

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(stats_handler)
```

In the first part of `stats_handler` we created a folder using [instance.new()](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Instance) and named it **leaderstats** and lastly parented it to the [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player). The `player` was returned by [PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded).
In the second part, we created an [IntValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/IntValue), named it "Points" and set its parent to the `leaderstats` folder.

Now, if you press `f5` to run the game. You can see leaderstats on your screen.

!!! caution
    The folder must be exactly named as **leaderstats**. In case of any misspelling or capitalizing, the Roblox engine will not create the leaderboard.

## Setting Values
Once created leaderstats you can set values by changing the `Value` property of [IntValue](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/IntValue). 

```lua
local function stats_handler(player)
    local leaderstats = Instance.new("Folder")
    leaderstats.Name = "leaderstats"
    leaderstats.Parent = player

    local points = Instance.new("IntValue")
    points.Name = "Points"
    points.Parent = leaderstats
    points.Value = 100
end

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(stats_handler)
```

No, if you run the game. Your points will be `100`.

## Implementing
As an example of usage. Create a part in the workspace and add [ClickDetector](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ClickDetector) to it. You can either make a separate script or use the ordinary one.
We will use [MouseClick](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/event/ClickDetector/MouseClick) event of [ClickDetector](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ClickDetector) which is fired whenever a player interacts with it. This event also returns that [Player](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Player).

<img src=https://github.com/Rodevs-Helpers/Helpers-Documents/blob/main/images/leaderstats3.png?raw=true width="500" height="500"/>

```lua
workspace.Part.ClickDetector.MouseClick:Connect(function(player)
    player.leaderstats..Points.Value = player.leaderstats.Points.Value + 1
end)
```
Now every time you click the part. It will increase your points by 1
