## Code Tips
``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - content.code.annotate # (1)
```

1.  I'm a code tip! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically.

## Code Highlight
``` py hl_lines="2 3"
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```

## Maths
$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$

The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
that $f(a)=f(b)$.

## Other updates

* Fixed several bugs.
* Anchor links.
* Fixed image rendering.
