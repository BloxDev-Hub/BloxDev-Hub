## Code Tips
!!! note annotate "Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus (1)"

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, (2) consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et
    euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo
    purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

2.  :woman_raising_hand: I'm a tip as well!


## Formatting
Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

{==

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.

- A^T^A

## Keyboard Keys

++ctrl+alt+del++

## Code Highlight
``` py hl_lines="2 3"
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
```

## Maths
$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$

The homomorphism $f$ is injective if and only if its kernel is only the 
singleton set $e_G$, because otherwise $\exists a,b\in G$ with $a\neq b$ such 
that $f(a)=f(b)$.

## Other updates

* Fixed several bugs.
* Anchor links.
* Fixed image rendering.
