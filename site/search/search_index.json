Now Steve can just come to Alex and ask her how her day's going, but she is away from her home right now. Steve decided to text Alex instead, then after a while, he received a text from Alex, saying that she is visiting her grandma and will return tomorrow.</p> <p>In this story, Steve is communicating with Alex through texting. Steve sent a question, wanting to know where Alex was and Alex responded with her being at her grandpa's house and she would return by tomorrow.</p> <p>HttpService works the same way. HttpService communicate with outer servers using the JSON format (not regular text!). In order to get information from server X, HttpService send a HTTP request to request data from X (through a method which we will cover in the next part). X will then respond with a data (also in JSON format) that satisfy the required information from HttpService.</p> What does JSON looks like? <p>JSON is simply a list of key-value pairs. The key is a string in \"\" and the value can be in number, boolean, array, list, etc.Each pairs is seperated with a comma. JSON data can be stored in a file with <code>.json</code> extension, and can be opened with a web browser like Chrome or Firefox.

In the example code, we created the function <code>func</code>. Inside the function, we created a variable <code>number</code> and store 1 in it. After that, we returned a <code>closure</code> function and inside closure, we added 1 in the number variable.</p> <p>We cached that closure function in a variable <code>v1</code>. Now whenever we call it, it adds \"1\" to the <code>number</code> variable. For the first time when we called the closure function, the variable \"number\" had 2 in it. So, after adding it becomes 3 and returned 3. When the closure function was called for the second time the number variable had 3 in it and after adding it became 4. And that's how a closure function works.</p> <p>Hope you understand it now. If there is still any confusion try reading it again.

So let's do that: The tiles that create the cross shape will be named \"Tile1\", the other four, \"Tile2\". Initially, all 9 tiles are gray colored, so how does the video shows blue and red? The trick here is: - Instead of gray, the tiles are colored with their designated colors at the beginning: Tile1 is blue, Tile2 is red. - Set the color target: Tile1 will be tweened red, while Tile2 will be tweened blue. - Distinguish the tiles using conditional statements. Since we set the tween <code>reverses</code> property to <code>true</code>, it will reverse back to it's original color. Instead of gray, it will be red and blue.

And not also that, if we are using anonymous functions (like in our case) we are going to be creating a new function every time and also as we have no reference for the connection of the second event we have no way of this to stop!</p> <p>A simple solution for this, would be using actual if statements and not nesting the events, for example:</p> <pre><code>local checkVariable = false\n\nevent1:Connect(function() checkVariable = true end)\nevent2:Connect(function()\n    if checkVariable then\n        ...\n    end\nend)\n</code></pre> <p>This will depend on every case, but in general, this is what most people try to do.</p>"},{"location":"Scripting/Intermediate-Courses/handling_events/#disconnecting-our-connections","title":"Disconnecting our connections","text":"<p>As we said earlier, Connect method returns a RBXScriptConnection or Connection, this datatype or object contains one but powerful method, which is Disconnect and as you guessed, when it gets called it disconnects the listener function from the event, the exact opposite thing that Connect does.

Our nested for loop, getting us x and y values from -50 to 50 lets us get positions for our chunks by multiplying that with the gap. 2. We set a height variable, which is a surprise tool we will use later.  3. We clone our chunk from ServerStorage and set its x and y to the values from our current iteration of the nested loop, multiplied by the gap. 4. We set the cloned chunk's parent to workspace, and repeat until all 1000 of our chunks are done.</p> <p>Personally, to make this a bit cleaner and more clear I would refactor this code to be put into a function that just takes the side length of the grid we want to create and a center point, so we can go ahead and do this.</p> <pre><code>function createGrid(sideLength: number, centerPoint: Vector3)\n    local half = sideLength/2\n    for xOffset = -half, half do\n        for yOffset = -half, half do\n            local coordinates = {\n                x = centerPoint.X + xOffset * gap;\n                y = centerPoint.Z + yOffset * gap\n            }\n            local height = 0\n            local clone = chunk:Clone()\n            clone.Position = Vector3.new(coordinates.x, centerPoint.Y + height, coordinates.y)\n            clone.Parent = workspace\n        end\n    end\nend\n</code></pre> <p>Info</p> <p>Don't mind the weird stuff next to the function arguments if you don't understand them, it's just making sure the arguments we pass in are the correct type using Luau type checking.</p> <p>You may notice I added the coordinates table, this is because we will need those x and z coordinates for not only the clone's position but to use with the noise function later.

The rest of this code is the same as earlier, just refactored to work as a function with arguments for sideLength.</p> <p>And calling this function to do the same thing we did earlier is as simple as this:  <pre><code>createGrid(100, Vector3.new(0,0,0))\n</code></pre></p> <p>There we go!
